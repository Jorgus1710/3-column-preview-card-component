## My process

Building with a mobile first approach. HTML + CSS. Nothing fancy here, using flexbox columns in mobile, then flexbox rows (default) for desktop view. I tried to use extensions for chrome (pixel perfect) in order to get as close to the source design as possible. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### Continued development

I will continue to refine my code to reduce bloat code, which no doubt exists here. The goal is to continue adapting techniques and learn from the community.
